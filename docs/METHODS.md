# Methods

## Sequence Collection

TP53 sequences were collected from NCBI for five species:
- Human (Homo sapiens)
- Pig (Sus scrofa)
- Rhesus Monkey (Macaca mulatta)
- Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
- Rat (Rattus norvegicus)

## Sequence Alignment

Sequences were aligned using ClustalW to identify conserved and variable regions across species.

## Variation Analysis

Variations were analyzed across species to identify:
1. Species-specific variations
2. Domain-specific variations
3. Conservation patterns

## GC Content Analysis

GC content was calculated for each species and analyzed across different domains of the TP53 gene.

## Visualization

Results were visualized using:
- Alignment conservation plots
- GC content distribution plots
- Domain variation heatmaps
