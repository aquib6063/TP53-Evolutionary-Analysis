# Results Interpretation

## Sequence Alignment

The alignment results show high conservation in core functional domains of TP53 across species, with notable variations in non-coding regions.

## Variation Analysis

Key findings from variation analysis:
1. Species-specific variations identified in pig TP53
2. Conservation patterns across functional domains
3. Potential functional implications of variations

## GC Content

GC content analysis reveals:
- Conservation of GC-rich regions in functional domains
- Species-specific GC content patterns
- Potential implications for gene expression and stability
